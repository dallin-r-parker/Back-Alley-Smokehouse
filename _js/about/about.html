      <h2 class="aboutHeadline">Best damn brisket you ever got from a nail salon</h2>
      <p class="sobStory">When the economy tanked, a down on his luck ex-carpenter who lost everything sold his car and used the money to start a smokehouse in the back room of a salon.  <br><br>  On his opening day, the street in front of his restaurant closed for construction.   Jon's first customers were the construction workers blocking his entrance from the public.  <br><br>  From that one room, due to the quality of his food, Jon expanded to a small seating area and finally into the entire building. <br><br> He eventually married the owner of the beauty parlor, and today the two of them run the smokehouse together.  </p>
